# LearnLooper.jl

**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

Call and response learning tool for learning by looping over a prerecorded song (or speech or video or...).

To try, [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/#install_julia) and then launch the REPL with `julia --project=path/to/LearnLooper.jl `. 

In the REPL, run
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.instantiate()

using LearnLooper

learn_demo()
```
